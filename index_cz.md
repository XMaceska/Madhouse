Muzika, Madhouse Express, on the psych stage on May 2015. <br>

Their style is mix of fuzzy, hazy 60s hypnosis, traditional rock´n ´roll in it's rawest form and new experimental elements which together make up their unique and fresh sound on the Czech scene.<br>

Live you can enjoy impressive stage show including catchy bass lines, forceful drum beats, intense guitar riffs, psychedelic visuals and the dramatic excentric merciless appearance of the singer doing his magic on a synthesizer.<br>
